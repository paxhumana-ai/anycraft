## Commit Message Guidelines

To keep the project history clean and easy to understand, please follow these guidelines when writing commit messages:

### Structure

1. **Title**: A brief summary of the changes (50 characters or less).
2. **Body** (optional): A detailed explanation of what has been changed and why.

### Best Practices

- **Use the imperative mood**: E.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature" or "Adding feature".
- **Be concise but descriptive**: Provide enough detail to understand the change without being verbose.
- **Separate logical changes**: Use separate commits for different changes to make the history easier to follow.

### Example

Fix issue with user login

- Correct the validation logic in the login form
- Update tests to cover the new validation rules
